# keylogger
Developed a keylogger application to track and log every keystroke typed on the keyboard. Designed for data recovery in cases of file corruption or unexpected shutdowns by capturing keystrokes covertly. Automatically emails the logged data to an admin at specified intervals, ensuring data retrieval without user knowledge.
